# Table-of-Content-JS
A jQuery code which can generate a responsive table of content for the webpage
# It applies to all webpages
The Table of content is in two designs: On the side of the page when screen size is big and on the top of the page for smaller screen
You need a body container with id = "content-container" and a precontent container with id = "precontent" for it to work
Please add the anchor tag into the html under <div id="precontent"></div>
Anchor tag: <div class="toc"> <div class="container-12"> <div class="grid-12"> </div> </div> </div>
